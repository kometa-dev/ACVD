### Info ###
This code is the implementation deriving from those papers:

Valette, "Approach-guided controlled resolution brain meshing for FE-based interactive neurosurgery simulation", Workshop on Mesh Processing in Medical Image Analysis, in conjunction with MICCAI 2011., Toronto, Canada, pp. 176--186, 09/2011.


This code is cross-platform and should compile under Linux ,MacOS and Window$ OS.
### Licence ###
This code is distributed under the CeCILL-B license (BSD-compatible)
(copyright CNRS, INSA-Lyon, UCBL, INSERM.)


###  Dependencies ###
* VTK www.vtk.org
  * Version above 6.x : use this branch
  * Version 5.x : use the vtk5 branch : https://github.com/valette/ACVD/tree/vtk5
* CMAKE www.cmake.org

###  Simple compilation HowTo under Linux ###
	git clone https://github.com/valette/ACVD.git
	cd ACVD
	cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	make

the executables (ACVD, ACVDQ, AnisotropicRemeshingQ and others should be found under the "bin" subdirectory)

### Usage ###
execute ACVD and ACVDQ without arguments to see the available options.

when using graphical display, the 'e' key allows to continue to the next step during interaction

for ACVD, the output is written in the file simplification.ply

additionnally, when running ACVD, a file output_1.ply is also written. It is the output mesh before post-processing using quadrics.

note that to enforce a manifold output mesh, such as explained in [3], you need to use the -m 1 option.

### Examples

#### Remeshing the Stanford bunny to 3000 vertices : ####
	wget https://github.com/alecjacobson/common-3d-test-models/raw/master/data/stanford-bunny.obj
	bin/ACVD stanford-bunny.obj 3000 0

taking into account curvature:

	bin/ACVD stanford-bunny.obj 3000 1.5

#### Remeshing the fandisk to 3000 vertices, taking into account sharp features with ACVDQ: ####
	wget https://github.com/alecjacobson/common-3d-test-models/raw/master/data/fandisk.obj
	bin/ACVDQ fandisk.obj 3000 0

#### Remeshing the horse to 1000 vertices with anisotropic metric: ####
	wget https://github.com/alecjacobson/common-3d-test-models/raw/master/data/horse.obj
	bin/AnisotropicRemeshingQ horse.obj 1000 1.5

for all the examples above, interactive visualization of the processing can be triggered by adding "-d 2" to the command lines

### Python port

A part of ACVD has been ported to python here: https://github.com/pyvista/pyacvd
